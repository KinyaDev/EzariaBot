# EzariaBot

EzariaBot is Custom Discord Bot for a Roleplay Server, but the project has been stopped (it's not mine).
You can fork it make your own Utility Bot especially for Roleplaying on Discord (Category system: places)

# ./.env

```env
TOKEN=YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN HERE
```

# IDs

In the code, a lot of channel and role IDs have not been put in a variable in ids.js, so... sorry you will have to change it.

## ./ids.js

````js
module.exports = {
  guildId: "GuildId",
  welcomeId: "WELCOME CHANNEL ID",
  logId: "LOG CHANNEL ID",
  verifiyId: "VERIFY ROLE ID",
  modoId: "MODERATOR ROLE ID",
  suggestId: ["SUGGESTION CHANNEL ID 1", "SUGGESTION CHANNEL ID 2"],
  accessId: "VERIFICATION CHANNEL ID",
};```
